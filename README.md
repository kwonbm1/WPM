How to run the program

First change directories to end up in the WPM folder/directory. Then, in the terminal type in "python3 app.py" and enter. Some things should pop up in the terminal but look for the line
that says "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000". The portion of the line "http://127.0.0.1:5000" should be hyperlinked in the terminal and by clicking it should take you to the website of the application.
